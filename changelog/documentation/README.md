# Discord Integration, new pages and more

## ðŸ’¬Discord Integration

This will push changes to the documentation straight to our external update channel in Discord.

_Yes it's a small change, using this post we'll test it._

## Documentation Streamlined

We've now separated all the building guides from the main documentation and changelogs. This allows for cleaner overall documentation, reducing chaos and improving readability. We've also made significant progress in adding our projects to the the "[project space](https://app.gitbook.com/o/3NLq4uuZBWfCNDv3xY44/s/XgzDoYdwl0Vuu3qB4KOp/)".

## New pages!

* Added different motherboards to the FAQ.
  * _Thanks, CharlotteBeLike._
* Cleaned up broken links.
* Nebula BoM is almost done.
* Adding a basic structure to the project environment (menu) for build instructions.
