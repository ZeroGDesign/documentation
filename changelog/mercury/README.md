# Announcement: New docs, working with GitBook and more

## ðŸ’¡Whatâ€™s changing?

We're moving to GitBook! GitBook is a platform that allows us to easily manage, modify and create documentation. This helps us future proof our project / documentation as it's easy to edit even for people that do not know how to code.

For us it's a major change, we can actually draw arrows, circles and add text straight into the docs without needing extra software to make this happen.

## Sync with GitHub

Our documentation is now synced with [GitHub](https://github.com/ZeroGDesign/documentation), allowing contributors to make changes without a GitBook account or team membership.

## Open Source Collaboration

A heartfelt thanks to GitBook for supporting us with an Open Source license. This marks a new chapter for ZeroG Docs. This opens a whole new world for ZeroG Docs!
