# Zero G

## Welcome

The Zero G documentation will give you a start building your project, learning all about 3D printing and more!

## Getting Started

On this website you’ll find all sorts of information, [ABS Printing Tips](https://docs.zerog.one/manual/print/abs), [Print Settings](https://docs.zerog.one/standard/print/settings), [Design Guidelines](https://docs.zerog.one/standard/cad/guidelines), [Mainsail Theme](https://docs.zerog.one/klipper/mainsail/theme), [Manuals](https://docs.zerog.one/manual/build) and more!

Currently we’re working on instructions for two of our projects. Our projects are **Mercury One.1** and **Hydra**.

_The documentation is still a work in progress so keep in mind it’s not complete._

{% content-ref url="guides/assembly/mercury-one.1/" %}
[mercury-one.1](guides/assembly/mercury-one.1/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="guides/assembly/hydra/" %}
[hydra](guides/assembly/hydra/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Discord

We’re a big [Discord](https://discord.gg/zerog) advocate! We love using it and building a community. Missing something in the documentation, need assistance, share your adventure, or enjoy a nice community? Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/zerog) today!

## Step Files!

The step files for Hydra and Mercury One.1 are now available.

Find them in the menu: Manual → [Mercury One.1](https://docs.zerog.one/manual/build/mercury_eva/printed_files) **OR** [Hydra](https://docs.zerog.one/manual/build/hydra/printed_files) → 3. Files. There is a section called “Step files”.
