# Announcement: New docs, working with GitBook and more

## ðŸ’¡ Whatâ€™s changing?

We're moving to GitBook! GitBook is a platform that allows us to easily manage, modify and create documentation. This helps us future proof our project / documentation as it's easy to edit even for people that do not know how to code.

For us it's a major change, we can actually draw arrows, circles and add text straight into the docs without needing extra software to make this happen.

### Sync with GitHub

Our GitBook documentation is setup to be synced with GitHub, this way you can make changes without needing to be part of a GitBook team or the need to have an account.

### GitBook Open Source License

We'd like to thank GitBook for giving us this opportunity to use their Open Source license. This opens a whole new world for ZeroG Docs!
