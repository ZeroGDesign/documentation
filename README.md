# Welcome to ZeroG

## Welcome

The Zero G documentation will give you a start building your project, learning all about 3D printing and more!

## Getting Started

On this website you’ll find all sorts of information, [ABS Printing Tips](guides/printing/printing-tips.md), [Print Settings](guides/printing/print-settings.md), [Design Guidelines](guides/design.md), [Mainsail Theme](https://docs.zerog.one/klipper/mainsail/theme), [Manuals](broken-reference) and more!

Currently we’re working on instructions for two of our projects. Our projects are **Mercury One.1** and **Hydra**.

_The documentation is still a work in progress so keep in mind it’s not complete._
