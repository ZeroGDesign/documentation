# Files

There are two ways to get the files: one is to use the [configurator](https://docs.zerog.one/manual/build/hydra/printed_files#-hydra-configurator), and the other is to download everything manually by clicking [here](https://github.com/ZeroGDesign/docs/tree/gh-pages/docs/assets/stl/hydra).

### Print settings <a href="#print-settings" id="print-settings"></a>

For the recommended settings when printing our parts, please click [here](https://docs.zerog.one/standard/print/settings). Deviating from these settings may result in lower quality prints, loss of features, and improper alignment.

### Step Files <a href="#step-files" id="step-files"></a>

You can now download the step files for our Mercury One.1! Select the appropriate size for your 3D printer:

* [Ender 5 (pro) Size - Hydra\_5pro.zip](https://docs.zerog.one/assets/stl/hydra/Hydra_5pro.zip)
* [Ender 5 Plus Size - Hydra\_5Plus.zip](https://docs.zerog.one/assets/stl/hydra/Hydra_5Plus.zip)

Simply click on the desired link and start creating your masterpiece with ease.

### Downloading STL Files <a href="#downloading-stl-files" id="downloading-stl-files"></a>

To get the files you need, you have two options: you can either download them all at once using the [configurator tool below](https://docs.zerog.one/manual/build/hydra/printed_files#-hydra-configurator), or you can download them individually from our Github page by clicking [here](https://github.com/ZeroGDesign/docs/tree/gh-pages/docs/assets/stl/hydra). Enjoy!

### Hydra Configurator <a href="#hydra-configurator" id="hydra-configurator"></a>

Enjoy! The files for your ZeroG Hydra setup, including all the STL files, are conveniently packaged into a Zip file by our configurator tool.
