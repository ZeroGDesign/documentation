# Introduction

## <mark style="color:red;">NEBULA</mark> <a href="#mercury-one1" id="mercury-one1"></a>

## <mark style="color:red;">What's this project about?</mark>

Nebula is the name of our custom frame/enclosure, some might know this is the 'beta enclosure'. It allows you to re-use many of your part on your current Mercury One.1/Hydra build and port them over a full custom frame giving you the ability to [print enclosed](#user-content-fn-1)[^1].

Nebula is also intended to be used as full from 'scratch' build. Giving you a nice, solid and square frame. We're working with LDO Motors to produce high-quality Nebula Kits.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is a unique frame, and your previous frame won't be used at all.

## <mark style="color:red;">Who's this project for?</mark> <a href="#whos-this-project-for" id="whos-this-project-for"></a>

This project is ideal for 3D printing enthusiasts who are currently using a Mercury One.1 / Hydra build and want to enclosure their setups. It's also perfect for those looking to start on a new build from scratch. Whether you want to upgrade your existing system or start fresh, the Nebula project allows both.&#x20;

## <mark style="color:red;">Expected Information in Instructions</mark>

In the instructions, you can expect detailed guidance on how to build the Nebula Project, with additional resources directing you to the Mercury One.1 and Hydra instructions, as these are essential for assembling the complete printer

## <mark style="color:red;">Additional Info</mark>

Building Nebula we expect you to source your materials for the Mercury One.1 and Hydra. We do include the electronics-bay Bill of Material under [these build instruction](#user-content-fn-2)[^2]s, by that we mean normal hardware, no electronics as of right now.

## <mark style="color:red;">Difficulty</mark> <a href="#difficulty" id="difficulty"></a>

We consider this build to be <mark style="color:purple;">moderate</mark> in difficulty. However, the more challenging aspects might be the firmware and wiring. As of now, we havenâ€™t written any configuration for Klipper, and some wires may need to be remade or extended.
