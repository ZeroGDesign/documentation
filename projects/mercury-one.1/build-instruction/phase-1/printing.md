# Printing

We're going to measure some parts to make sure you've got the correct files to print. This is highly important to make sure pulleys and idlers move smoothly.

## Measure your toothed idler

We support several types of toothed idlers. To find the correct spacers, measure your idler’s height and check the next page for the corresponding spacers.

## Find your spacer

Print the matching spacer to your idler’s height. Each spacer has one (1) dot[^1] for 8.5mm, two (2) for 9mm, and three (3) for 10mm.

The Configurator should include the correct file for you, but we’ve also included direct links below.

Once measured, the tabs below will tell you what the printed spacer should look like, if it's hard to see click the image to enlarge it.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="10mm" %}
#### You measured 10mm

Here is an example of the printed spacer you need

[^1]: The printed spacers include a small dot in the bottom that'll tell you the size so you don't lose track.
