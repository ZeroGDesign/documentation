# Mercury One.1

We're still working on our new documentation website, for now we'll have the Mercury One.1 instructions available as a PDF.

## Build Instructions <a href="#build-instructions" id="build-instructions"></a>

It’s time to roll up our sleeves and get building with the release of our long-awaited PDF build instructions for the Mercury One.1.

We owe a huge debt of gratitude to our incredible community member,  _<mark style="color:red;">**Jonspaceharper**</mark>, for their dedication in bringing these instructions to life._

But we couldn’t have done it without you, our community! Your continuous feedback and support have been instrumental in refining both the build instructions and the project itself.
