# Introduction

## <mark style="color:red;">MERCURY ONE.1</mark> <a href="#mercury-one1" id="mercury-one1"></a>

## <mark style="color:red;">What's this project about?</mark>

The Mercury One.1 upgrade transforms your current Ender 5(Pro/Plus) into a CoreXY system. This provides an improvement over the Cartesian system, which relies on V-rollers that may lack precision and demand considerable maintenance. Additionally, the CoreXY system is optimized for higher speeds, enhancing your 3D printing experience and quality.

If you’re an Ender 5, Ender 5 Pro, or Ender 5 Plus owner who is dissatisfied with print quality, speed, or encountering other issues, consider this upgrade. Whether you’re interested in learning how to modify printers or simply seeking an enjoyable new project, this is the perfect opportunity for you!

## <mark style="color:red;">What machines does this run on?</mark>

We support the Ender 5, Ender 5 Pro, and Ender 5 Plus frames when upgrading to Mercury One.1. To install this upgrade, you will need to remove the X and Y motion system from the existing frame.\
<mark style="color:red;">**Please note**</mark>**&#x20;that some&#x20;**<mark style="color:red;">**soldering or wire extension may be necessary**</mark> during this process.

### <mark style="color:red;">Difficulty</mark> <a href="#difficulty" id="difficulty"></a>

We consider this build to be easy to moderate in difficulty. However, the more challenging aspects might be the firmware and wiring. As of now, we haven’t written any configuration for Klipper, and some wires may need to be remade or extended.
